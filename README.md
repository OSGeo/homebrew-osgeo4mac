# Homebrew-osgeo4mac

**Build Status**: [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/OSGeo/homebrew-osgeo4mac.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/OSGeo/homebrew-osgeo4mac)

This is the [homebrew's][homebrew] tap for the **stable** versions of the [OSGeo][osgeo] geospatial toolset. Right now our main focus is to provide and up-to-date [QGIS][qgis] formulae easy to install to the end user. The tap includes formulae that may not be specifically
from an OSGeo project, but do extend the toolset's functionality

## How do I install these formulae?

Just `brew tap osgeo/osgeo4mac` and then `brew install <formula>`. Easy, isn't it? 

You can also install via URL:

```shell
$ brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OSGeo/homebrew-osgeo4mac/master/Formula/<formula>.rb
```

## Docs

Run `brew help`, `man brew`, or check the Homebrew [documentation][].
