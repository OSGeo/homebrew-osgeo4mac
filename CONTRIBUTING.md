# Contributing to Homebrew-osgeo4mac

First time contributing to Homebrew-osgeo4mac? Read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How...

### To report a bug

* Run `brew update` (twice). 
* Run and read `brew doctor`. 
* Read [the Hombrew Troubleshooting Checklist](https://docs.brew.sh/Troubleshooting). 
* Read the how to [report issues](https://github.com/OSGeo/homebrew-osgeo4mac/wiki/Reporting-issues) and the [troubleshooting](https://github.com/OSGeo/homebrew-osgeo4mac/wiki/Troubleshooting).  
* [Search](https://github.com/OSGeo/homebrew-osgeo4mac/issues) for same issue or similar to yours in the repo. 
* If there is no similar issue, open or closed, [open an issue](https://github.com/OSGeo/homebrew-osgeo4mac/issues/new) on the repo.

### To submit a version upgrade for the `foo` formula

* Check if the same upgrade has been already submitted by [searching the open pull requests for `foo`](https://github.com/OSGeo/Homebrew-osgeo4mac/pulls?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+foo).
* `brew bump-formula-pr --strict foo` with `--url=...` and `--sha256=...` or `--tag=...` and `--revision=...` arguments.

### To add a new formula for `foo` version `2.3.4` from `$URL`

* Read [the Formula Cookbook](https://docs.brew.sh/Formula-Cookbook) or: `brew create $URL` and make edits
* `brew install --build-from-source foo`
* `brew audit --new-formula foo`
* `git commit` with message formatted `foo 2.3.4 (new formula)`
* [Open a pull request](https://docs.brew.sh/How-To-Open-a-Homebrew-Pull-Request) and fix any failing tests

### To contribute with a fix to the `foo` formula

#### You already know about Git

If you are already well versed in the use of `git`, then you can find the local
copy of the `homebrew-core` repository in this directory
(`$(brew --repository homebrew/core)`), modify the formula there
leaving the section `bottle do ... end` unchanged, and prepare a pull request
as you usually do.  Before submitting your pull request, be sure to test it
with these commands:

```shell
$ brew uninstall --force foo
$ brew install --build-from-source foo
$ brew test foo
$ brew audit --strict foo
```

After testing, if you think it is needed to force the corresponding bottles to be
rebuilt and redistributed, add a line of the form `revision 1` to the formula,
or add 1 to the revision number already present.

#### You don't know about Git

If you are not already well versed in the use of `git`, then you may learn
a little bit about it from the [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/How-To-Open-a-Homebrew-Pull-Request) and then proceed as
follows:

* Run `brew edit foo` and make edits.
* Leave the section `bottle do ... end` unchanged.
* Test your changes using the commands listed above.
* Run `git commit` with message formatted `foo <insert new version number>` or `foo: <insert details>`. 
* Open a pull request as described in the introduction linked to above, wait for the automated test results, and fix any failing tests.
