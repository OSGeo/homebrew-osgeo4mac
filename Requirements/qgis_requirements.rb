      Another QGIS formula is linked: #{qgis_f}.
      Do `brew unlink #{qgis_f}` then try installing this formula again.
      You can leave #{qgis_f} unlinked and installed as keg-only;
      however, launching it as keg-only may cause issues or crashes, since it
      will be now be referencing Python modules of the newly linked QGIS.

      Issue can be overcome by setting PYTHONPATH, e.g. in the app's Options.

  def message
    <<-EOS.undent
      Python could not import the PyQt4.pyqtconfig module. This will cause the QGIS build to fail.
      The most common reason for this failure is that the PYTHONPATH needs to be adjusted.
      The `pyqt` caveats explain this adjustment and may be reviewed using:

          brew info pyqt

      Ensure `pyqt` formula is installed and linked, and that it includes the `pyqtconfig` module.
